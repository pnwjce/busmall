# Marketing Research Team 
As a Marketing Research Team I want a page that is easy to use, and fun for the participant. I want it to be something that participants can do quickly, and easily, while still giving them a good sample size of products to choose from. 
# Developer 
As the Developer I need to create a page that is easy to use, and encourages people to participate in the product research. I need to make sure that the images are shown randomly, without repetition, giving the participant a good sample size. I need to track both number of times chosen (liked), and the number of times the product appears to the participant (shown). There should be a chart of some sort for the participant to see once they are done. 
# Participant
As a Participant I want to feel that my opinions do matter, and that it is easy for me to participate. The page needs to be clear in directions, and visually appealing but not busy.
